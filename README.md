Boyer-Moore String Comparison
===========

This is a simple Java implementation of Boyer Moore string comparison algorithm.

It finds the first match of pattern string in text string, like the java.lang.String.indexof does.

It could jump a few characters once a mismatch occurs. 

It benefits longer pattern string and it will be considered much faster then original java.lang.String.indexof.
