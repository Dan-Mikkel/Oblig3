Boyer-Moore String Searching
===========

This is a Java library for Boyer Moore string searching algorithm.

It finds the first match of pattern string in text string, like the java.lang.String.indexof does.

It could jump a few characters once a mismatch occurs. and that benefits longer pattern string. 

It will be considered much faster then original java.lang.String.indexof with long patterns.
